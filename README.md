Notes and other cheat sheets about various programming related topics

The motivation for this repo is to collect various information I find that I keep needing while coding, starting with a solid reference for markdown syntax in particular - which is this `README.md` document.

So here are my rules about writing markdown.

  - **Soft wrap lines**
    To facilitate editing use one line per paragraph. Modern editors can soft wrap things easily enough. The one caveat is that it does make the document a little less readable in standard ASCII mode, but generally we are going to consider that a reasonable sacrifice in order to achieve more easily written documents
    
  - **Item -> Detail Lists**
    This seems to come up all the time! Effectively something similar to a dictionary list. This list of rules demonstrates the basic idea.
